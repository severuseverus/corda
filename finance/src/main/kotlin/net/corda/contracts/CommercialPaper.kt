/**
 * This is an ultra-trivial implementation of commercial paper, which is essentially a simpler version of a corporate
 * bond. It can be seen as a company-specific currency. A company issues CP with a particular face value, say $100,
 * but sells it for less, say $90. The paper can be redeemed for cash at a given date in the future. Thus this example
 * would have a 10% interest rate with a single repayment. Commercial paper is often rolled over (the maturity date
 * is adjusted as if the paper was redeemed and immediately repurchased, but without having to front the cash).
 *
 * This contract is not intended to realistically model CP. It is here only to act as a next step up above cash in
 * the prototyping phase. It is thus very incomplete.
 *
 * Open issues:
 *  - In this model, you cannot merge or split CP. Can you do this normally? We could model CP as a specialised form
 *    of cash, or reuse some of the cash code? Waiting on response from Ayoub and Rajar about whether CP can always
 *    be split/merged or only in secondary markets. Even if current systems can't do this, would it be a desirable
 *    feature to have anyway?
 *  - The funding steps of CP is totally ignored in this model.
 *  - No attention is paid to the existing roles of custodians, funding banks, etc.
 *  - There are regional variations on the CP concept, for instance, American CP requires a special "CUSIP number"
 *    which may need to be tracked. That, in turn, requires validation logic (there is a bean validator that knows how
 *    to do this in the Apache BVal project).
